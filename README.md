<h1>A&E Assignment Generator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This script, developed using UiPath, streamlines the nurse shift assignment process for the Emergency Department at Singapore General Hospital. By automating the allocation of nurses to specific duties, the script enhances operational efficiency and ensures optimal staff deployment. It consolidates real-time data to generate clear and accurate shift assignments, allowing for better resource management and improved patient care.

This tool was aimed to reduce the administrative burdens and enhance the overall workflow in a fast-paced environment.

This repository's purpose is to showcase the overall concept, functionality and application of the script, rather than the details of the code.
